So, they've been doing\\nthat for a few years. But with GPUs, no one's ever done... And no one's ever done the scale of water cooling that Elon just did. Now, next generation Nvidia is for the highest end GPU,\\nit is mandatory water cooling. You have to water cool it. But Elon did it on this\\ncurrent generation, and that required a lot of stuff. If you look at some of\\nthe satellite photos and stuff of the Memphis facility, there's all these external\\nwater chillers that are sitting, basically, it looks like\\na semi-truck pod thing. What's it called? The container. But really, those are water chillers. And he has like 90 of those water chillers just sitting outside, 90\\ndifferent containers with water, like chill the water, bring\\nit back to the data center, and then you distribute\\nit to all the chips, pull all the heat out,\\nand then send it back. And this is both a way to cool the chips, but it's also an efficiency thing. And going back to that sort of three\\nvector thing right there is, there is memory bandwidth\\nFLOPS and interconnect. The closer the chips are together, the easier it is to do\\nhigh speed interconnects. And so, this is also like a reason why you wanna go water cooling is because you can just put the chips right next to each other, and therefore get higher\"),\n",

So, I think you're right in that sense that OpenAI, or Trump is championing people are gonna build more and his actions are gonna let people build more. - What are you excited about these several years that are upcoming in terms of cluster build outs, in terms of breakthroughs in AI? Like the best possible future you can imagine in the next couple years, two, three, four years? What does that look like? Just it could be very specific technical things like breakthroughs on post post-training, or it could be just size big. - [Dylan] Yeah, I mean it's- - Impressive clusters. - I really enjoy tracking supply chain and who's involved in what. (Lex laughing) - Yeah. - I really do. It's really fun to see the numbers, the cost, who's building what capacity, helping them figure out how much capacity they should build, winning deals, strategic stuff, that's really cool. I think technologically, there's a lot around the networking side that really excites me with optics and electronics getting closer and closer, whether it be co-packaged optics, or some sort of forms of new forms of switching. - This is internal to a cluster. - Cluster.

I understand the idea, but it's just so hard to predict what is the breakthrough that'll make something like that work. And I think it's more likely that we have breakthroughs that work and things that we don't know what they're gonna do. So, everyone wants agents. Dario has a very eloquent way of describing this. And I just think that it's like, there's gonna be more than that. So, just expect these things to come. - I'm gonna have to try to pin you down to a date on the AGI timeline, (chuckles) like the nuclear weapon moment. So, moment where on the geopolitical stage.

For me, it's probably after 2030, so I'm not as- - That's what I would say. - So, define that. Because to me, it almost has already happened. You look at elections in India and Pakistan, people get AI voice calls, and think they're talking to the politician.

              "{'context': \"making crazy amounts of money because they're the only\\none with the capability. - Do they need that money?\\nAre they using it for R&D? - They're losing money\\nobviously as a company, because they spend so much on training. So, the inference itself\\n- Right. - is a very high margin, but it doesn't recoup the cost of everything else they're doing. - Okay.\\n- So, yes, they need that money because the revenue and margins pay for continuing\\nto build the next thing, - So-\\n- alongside raising more money. - So, the suggestion is that DeepSeek is like really bleeding out money. - Well, so here's one thing. We'll get to this in a second. But DeepSeek doesn't have any capacity to actually serve the model. They stop signups. The ability to use it is\\nlike non-existent now. For most people because so many\\npeople are trying to use it, they just don't have the GPUs to serve it. OpenAI has hundreds of\\nthousands of GPUs between them and Microsoft to serve their models. DeepSeek has a factor of much lower. Even if you believe our\\nresearch, which is 50,000 GPUs, and a portion of those are for research, portion of those are for the hedge fund, they still have nowhere\\nclose to the GPU volumes and capacity to serve the model at scale. So, it is cheaper. A part of that is OpenAI\\nmaking a ton of money. Is DeepSeek making money on their API? Unknown. I don't actually think so. And part of that is this chart. Look at all the other providers. Together AI, Fireworks AI\\n\\nsomething that gives huge gains. And I expect most companies\\nthat are serving their models to move to this mixture\\nof experts implementation. Historically, the reason\\nwhy not everyone might do it is because it's a\\nimplementation complexity, especially when doing these big models. So, this is one of the things\\nthat DeepSeek gets credit for is they do this extremely well. They do a mixture of\\nexperts extremely well. This architecture for what\\nis called DeepSeekMoE. MoE is the shortened version of mixture of experts,\\nis multiple papers old. This part of their training infrastructure is not new to these models alone, and same goes for what Dylan mentioned, with multi-head latent attention. This is all about reducing\\nmemory usage during inference. And same things during training, by using some fancy low\\nrank approximation math. If you get into the details\\nwith this latent attention, it's one of those things I look at, and it's like, okay, they're doing really\\ncomplex implementations, 'cause there's other\\nparts of language models such as embeddings that are used to extend\\nthe context length. The common one that DeepSeek used is rotary positional impendings,\\nwhich is called RoPE. And if you want to use\\nRoPE with a normal MoE, it's a sequential thing. You take two of the attention matrices and you rotate them by a\\ncomplex value rotation, which is a matrix multiplication. With DeepSeek's MLA, with this\\n\\nthe, again, across the stack. But the post-training probably this year, there's going to be a lot\\nof interesting developments in the post-training. We'll talk about it. I almost forgot to talk\\nabout the difference between DeepSeek-V3 and R1\\non the user experience side. So, forget the technical\\nstuff, forget all of that. Just people that don't\\nknow anything about AI, they show up like what's\\nthe actual experience, what's the use case for each one when they actually type and talk to it? - Yeah.\\n- What is each good at and that kind of thing. - So, let's start with DeepSeek-V3. Again, it's more people would\\nhave tried something like it. You ask it a question, it'll start generating tokens very fast, and those tokens will look like\\na very human legible answer. It'll be some sort of markdown list. It might have formatting to help you draw to the\\ncore details in the answer. And it'll generate tens\\nto hundreds of tokens. Say token is normally\\na word for common words or a sub-word part in a longer word. And it'll look like a\\nvery high quality Reddit or Stack Overflow answer. These models are really getting good at doing these across a wide\\nvariety of domains, I think. Even things that if you're an expert, things that are close to\\nthe fringe of knowledge, they will still be\\nfairly good at, I think. Cutting edge AI topics\\nthat I do research on, these models are capable for study aide, and they're regularly updated. Where this changes is\\n\\nhad started this in the fall. It's now really popular reasoning models. The next thing to do for\\nopen source post-training is to scale up verifiers, to scale up data to replicate\\nsome of DeepSeek's results. And it's awesome that\\nwe have a paper to draw and that it makes it a lot easier. And that's the type of things that is going on among academic and closed frontier research in AI. - Since you're pushing open source, what do you think is the future of it? Do you think DeepSeek\\nactually changes things since it's open source or open-weight or is pushing the open source movement into the open direction? - This goes very back to\\nthe license discussion. So, DeepSeek-R1 with a friendly\\nlicense is a major reset. So, it's like the first time that we've had a really\\nclear frontier model that is open-weights and with a commercially friendly license with no restrictions on\\ndownstream use cases, synthetic data, distillation, whatever. This has never been the case at all in the history of AI in the\\nlast few years since ChatGPT. There have been models\\nthat are off the frontier or models with weird licenses that you can't really use them. - So, isn't Meta's license pretty much permissible\\nexcept for five companies? And there's also... So, this goes to what open\\nsource AI is, which is, there's also use case\\nrestrictions in the Llama license, which says you can't use\\nit for specific things. So, if you come from an open\\nsource software background, you would say that that is\",\n",
